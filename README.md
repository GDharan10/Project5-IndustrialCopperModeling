## About

The Industrial Copper Modeling project consists of predictive models built using various machine learning algorithms. Two main functionalities are provided:

1. **Predict Selling Price**: This feature allows users to input various parameters related to copper items, such as quantity, country, item type, etc., and predicts the selling price based on these inputs.

2. **Predict Status**: Users can input similar parameters along with the selling price, and the model predicts the status of the copper item, whether it will be won or lost.

The project utilizes Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and Streamlit for model development, data manipulation, and web application deployment.

## Features

- Predictive models for selling price and status classification.
- Interactive Streamlit web application for easy access.
- Input validation and error handling for a smooth user experience.

## Installation

To run the Industrial Copper Modeling application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/industrial-copper-modeling.git
